        <p>The data from this list came from the Ministry of Trade's Consumer Affairs Division <a href="http://tradeind.gov.tt/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Supermarket-Pricelist-Booklet.pdf">booklet of supermarket prices</a></p>
        <p>It's currently a snapshot.  Having access to the actual location of the list data, in an open format would allow this solution to be refreshed more readily</p>
        <p>There are also other cool remixes that can be done with this <a href="https://github.com/irwinwilliams/price-range">data &amp; site</a>, so have at it!</p>
